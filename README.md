# Lora Sender & Reciver

Initial Version:
Using 2 Heltec Esp32 Lora to make a simple communication between a sender and a receiver.
The initial version of the code sends a counter value that increases every 500ms, it also monitors RSSI and the RX size.
Turn on only the receiver will make him wait until the sender turns on.

#Future Work:
Add a DHT11 and SDS011 to monitor PM, temperature and humidity
